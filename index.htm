			<p>I still don't quite understand what is the big benefit for using Git and GitHub.</p>
			<p>Okay, maybe GitHub allows developers and other text authors to share their texts and receive/provide contribution from/to other authors work.</p>
			<p>But, using Git itself actually adds-on extra work to be done for no reasonable reason. When it's possible to keep an organized history control within files and directories, Git allows authors to keep their history in a easier and faster way. Or not, when you really must keep on focusing on Git to make sure the texts don't get messed/mixed up, doing the so called Commits every single time any smallest changes are done, such as replacing a period (.) with an exclamation (!). The author would spend extra effort and time doing commits.</p>
			<p>However, my attempt is to use Git as a version AND backup system, where I can roll-back commits and actually affect the actual files. As an easy and fast way to keep backups.</p>
			<p>I am going to commit this file with this line, edit the line, recommit and attempt a roll-back.</p>
			<p>...Seems like "Roll-back" a commit does not touch the files but "Revert" commit does. Which means Git would work for me as a backup and version control system.</p>
